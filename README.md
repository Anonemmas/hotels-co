  ## Strategy to create a modern platform from a legacy platform (Step by step)

  ## 1. Plan

  - I would meet with the business team, product owner and the developers to clearly brainstorm the objective of the project and to make sure everyone is on the same page
  - Analysing the work we need to do and the resources required to complete the first version of the App the (MVP)
  - Creating KPIs to measure our success after 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and so on.

  ## 2. Creating a workflow

  - With any new team, it's necessary to have a workflow that will scale overtime and that will help each member of the team reach their goals. This will include choosing tech stack e.g Frontend Frameworks, Backend language, Communication channels, length of sprints, frequency of standup meetings and so on.
  - After planning we would have a rough sketch of the activities that need to be carried out to reach our goal, therefore we would break down the tasks into sprints and start assigning the responsible people on those tasks, including designers, testers, frontend, backend developers and other members of the development team
  - Creating teams on platforms such as github (organisation) or bitbucket, slack, work emails and more and making sure everyone involved is onboarded on those groups
  - Creating different domains for testing our application like dev, staging and production links.
  - Setting up CI/CD for faster and more seemless continuos integration 

  ## 3. Designing the application

  - After selecting the tools and frameworks, the design team should start on creating the first few designs to get the project started.
  - I would work with the backend team to create the structure of the data in terms of necessary tables and schemas of how the data should look from the initial conversations
  - Working with the frontend and Backend to create an architecture that will be scalable as we grow and that can sustain traffic of millions of people and all served well
 
  ## 4. Start Development of the MVP

  - After the designs are finished, the development of the frontend would immediately start, while mantaining the discussed structure and common best practices such as component based architecture, keeping in mind accessibility and utilizing SOLID principles.

  ## 5. Testing and continuous quality checks

  - Automated tests would have to be integrated at the same time as the development process by both the frontend developers creating end-to-end tests and backend creating unit tests.
  - More so, manual testers should be in place to test the app as soon as we send the changes to the staging link which is like the preproduction phase
  - The manual testers should create tickets for the bugs caught while testing and thoroughly mentioning out where the user experience can be enhanced for a smoother app experience
  - Holding test sessions with a few users or people from the business team and observing how they interact with the app and how the overall user experience can be improved.
 
  ## 6. Deploying the app

  - Two days before the end of the sprint the changes should be pushed to staging for testing and leaving atleast a day for bug fixes if any are caught during the testing phase
  - After everything checks out, at the end of every sprint all the sprint's changes would be merged into the production branch
 
  ## 7. Documenting the release and gathering feedback from our users

  - After each release, we would create a list of the new features that were worked on and what we're going to prioritize in the next sprint to discuss with the business team and make sure we're still inline with our objective
  - We would gather feedback from the users of our app to understand how our app could be improved, either by doing surveys, live user testing sessions and more.
 
  ## 8. Mantaining the team's morale and focus

  - Getting the team to stay focused is a challenging aspect of software development, I would constantly analyse each individual's performance to understand when there are burnouts because of high workloads, getting discouraged or other issues that could slow down the team.
  - Creating time for team building activities like fun games, study sessions for general bonding of the team and overall development of each member in the team.
 
  ## 9. Launching the MVP

  - The MVP is a crucial milestone in the development process, we would launch the MVP in about 3 months or less depending on the complexity of the KPIs set for the MVP. This will motivate the developers and the business team to keep moving forward as it's a tangible stepping stone.
 
  ## 10. Continuos feature drop and re-alignment of tasks

  - As the development proceeds some of the tasks and roadmap targets change along the way, we would keep restrategizing towards what the end consumer is looking for
  - Creating more features and going through the process over again, testing, bug fixing and sending out features

  ## 11. Project completion

  - After the major KPIs have been met and the software is stable, I would sit down with the managers, stakeholders to assess on the perfomance of the project and what could be improved
  - After the project is stable, the product will be handed to the client and maintenance would continue for the existence of the app
